This is a small library to create bots, scripts and tools about Wikidata
Lexemes. It's philosophy is to have a transparent thin layer on top of the
internal datastuctures enriched with convenient functions without hiding the
power of the access to the internals.

LexData is still in beta phase and there fore some features are missing and
functions might be renamed in future.

The code of AitalvivemBot was used as a starting point, but probably theres not
a single line of code that wasn't rewritten.

Install from pypi:
```
 $ pip3 install LexData
```
